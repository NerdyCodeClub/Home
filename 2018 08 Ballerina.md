# August 2018 Ballerina

This time we all agreed to take a spin with Ballerina <https://ballerina.io/>

Ballerina is a compiled, transactional, statically and strongly typed programming language with textual and graphical syntaxes. Ballerina incorporates fundamental concepts of distributed system integration into the language and offers a type safe, concurrent environment to implement microservices with distributed transactions, reliable messaging, stream processing, and workflows.

Features:

* API Constrcuts
* Logic Language
* Asynchronous
* JSON & XML
* Annotations
* Statically and Strongly Typed
* Streams

* API Integration Support:

  * Type Safe endpoint integration
  * Type safe connectors
  * Reliable messaging
  * Distributed transactions
  * Circuit breaker
  * Protection against injection attacks
  * Docker & Kubernetes

Things to looks into: there is a lot of examples for every feature the language supports, some of what I find cool things to explore are:

* Message broker
* Cirtcuit breaker
* Observability
* Concurrency
* Routing
